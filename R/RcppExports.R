#' useful function that acts like print() in R

#' lpd (Log-Pointwise Density of REM)
#'
#' @param pars is a vector of parameters (note: the order must be aligned witht the column order in 'stats')
#' @param stats is a matrix of dimensions n_dyads*variables with statistics of interest by column and dyads by row.
#' @param event is a vector of 1/0 : 1 indicating the observed dyad and 0 the non observed dyads.
#' @param interevent_time the time difference between the current time point and the previous event time.
#'
#' @return log-pointwise density value of a specific time point

#' nllik (Negative Log-Likelihood of REM)
#'
#' @param pars is a vector of parameters (note: the order must be the same as the column order in 'stats') at which to calculate the likelihood value
#' @param stats is a cube of dimensions n_dyads*variables*M with statistics of interest by column and dyads by row.
#' @param event_binary is a matrix of ones and zeros of dimensions M*n_dyads : 1 indicating the observed dyad and 0 the non-observed dyads.
#' @param interevent_time the vector of time differences between the current time point and the previous event time (note: interevent time at t_1 is t_1-0=t_1, since t_0 = 0).

#'
#' @return negative log likelihood value
